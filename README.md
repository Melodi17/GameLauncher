## FAQ

**My game is showing incorrect details, such as name and image**

You can override it in the game details screen by clicking the ... on a game, then clicking the dropdown and override metadata.



**A game isn't showing up**

Make sure the game is inside the folder you have set as the scan dir (it cannot detect outside this), and that you have tried adding it manually.



**How do I update it?**

From version 1.5.0 and above, you can automatically update in settings using the "Check for updates" button, alternatively you can download and replace the executable manually from the GitHub.



**Where does it store its data?**

All the the applications data is stored under `%UserProfile%/GameLauncher`, you may copy this between computers to copy configs, but note that it does contain your IGDB credentials. Games data is stored inside the game folder, in the `gl.resources` folder and the `launch.dat` file.



**Can I add multiple start profiles?**

Yes! You can edit the `launch.dat` file in the game's folder with another line with your profile name and the executable you want it to search for: `windowed version=GameW.exe`
